			"taskTitle": "Project Structure Setup",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project structure setup into specific subtasks including: 1) Creating the directory structure, 2) Initializing git repository with appropriate .gitignore, 3) Creating README.md with basic documentation, and 4) Setting up requirements.txt file.",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward task involving basic file system operations and project initialization. The requirements are clearly defined with a specific directory structure. No complex logic is required, just creation of directories and files with basic content."

			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the JSON parsing functionality into subtasks: 1) Implement file reading and basic JSON parsing, 2) Add validation for n8n node structure, and 3) Implement error handling for common failure cases (file not found, malformed JSON, etc.).",
			"reasoning": "This task involves file I/O and JSON parsing which are standard operations. The complexity is slightly higher than basic setup as it requires validation logic to ensure the JSON conforms to n8n's expected structure. Error handling adds some complexity but the implementation example is already provided."
